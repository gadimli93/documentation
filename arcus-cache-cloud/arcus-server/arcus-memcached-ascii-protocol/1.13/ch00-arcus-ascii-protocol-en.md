# ARCUS memcached Ascii Protocol

Introducing the ASCII protocol of instructions provided by ARCUS Cache Server.
Currently, a binary protocol is not supported, so it will be excluded from the discussion.

This documentation mainly targets ARCUS Cache Client developers, and can also refer to readers interested in ARCUS Cache Server.

## Collection Support

From the perspective of ASCII protocol, besides the existing memcached features the 
ARCUS Cache Server provides a *Collection* feature. In addition to the simple key-value with only one data.
multiple data can be stored/retrieved in a structured form. 
Provided collection types in ARCUS Cache Server are as follows.

- **list :** linked list structure of the data
- **set :** unique set of data suitable for membership inspection
- **map :** field based hash structure as a set of data consisting of <field, value> pair.
- **b+tree :** set of data arranged based on the b+tree key, suitable for range scan processing.

## Basic Concepts

Basic terms and concepts such as cache key, item, slab, etc., required to use ARCUS Cache Server are explained in 
[ARCUS Basic Concept](ch01-arcus-basic-concept-en.md), therefore it's commended to read this first.

Important factors such as collection and element structure, b+tree key, and element flag provided by
ARCUS Cache Server are introduced in [Collection Basic Concept](ch02-collection-items-en.md).

Item attributes have been expanded by providing collection features, which are covered in detail in 
[Item Attribute Description](ch03-item-attributes-en.md)

## Simple Key-Value Feature

The ARCUS Cache Server provides key-value commands based on memcached `1.4`, and for some of them provides extended commands.
Therefore, commands that are used in the existing memcached `1.4` can also be used in the ARCUS Cache Server.
Introducing instructions that can be performed for key-value type items in [Key-Value Command](ch04-command-key-value-en.md).

## Collection Feature

Please refer to the below list for a detailed description of the collection commands:

- [List Collection Command](ch05-command-list-collection-en.md)
- [Set Collection Command](ch06-command-set-collection-en.md)
- [Map Collection Command](ch07-command-map-collection-en.md)
- [B+tree Collection Command](ch08-command-btree-collection-en.md)

Some of the collection commands are command pipelining processable and will be described in the
[Command Pipelining Feature](ch09-command-pipelining-en.md) chapter.

## Item Attributes Feature

Thanks to the collection support, item types have diversified, and depending on the type of item,
item attributes have also been expanded accordingly.
[Item Attribute Commands](ch10-command-item-attribute-en.md) are provided to retrieve or update item attributes.


## Admin & Monitoring Feature

Necessary functions required for the operation of the ARCUS Cache Server are provided by the 
[Admin & Monitoring commands](ch11-command-administration-en.md).
