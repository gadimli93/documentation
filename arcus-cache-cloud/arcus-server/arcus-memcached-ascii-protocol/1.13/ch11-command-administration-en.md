## FLUSH Command

ARCUS Cache Server supports two flush commands in order to invalidate the items.

- **flush_all** : flush all items
- **flush_prefix** : flush items only with the specific prefix. 

Although the flush operation invalidates the items, it does not immediately return the occupied memory space of those items.
Instead, by recording the information at the point of flush execution time as global information of ARCUS Cache Server,
it makes it possible to discover the items that existed before that point are invalidated.
Therefore, each time an item is accessed, there is an inconvenience of checking whether the item is invalidated or not.
However, the flush operation itself is completed at O(1) time.

`flush_all` command only records the flush execution time information and leaves out the statistical information of all 
prefixes as it is. Therefore, even though items are flushed by `flush_all` command, their statistical information are 
intact and retrievable. When all items belonging to the prefix are removed, statistical information of that
prefix is also removed together. On the other hand, the difference of `flush_prefix` command from the `flush_all`command is that,
`flush_prefix` command records the flush execution time information for the corresponding prefix, and 
removes all the statistical information of that prefix by reset. Therefore, after execution of the `flush_prefix` command,
it is not possible to retrieve statistical information about the corresponding prefix.

Syntaxes of the two flush commands are as follows.

```
flush_all [<delay>] [noreply]\r\n
flush_prefix <prefix> [<delay>] [noreply]\r\n
```

- \<prefix> - a prefix string. when "\<null\>" is used, then items without a prefix string are invalidated.
- \<delay\> - specified at the time of delayed invalidation request and its delay period is specified in SECONDS.
- noreply - if state this, response string will be omitted.

Response strings and their meaning are as follows.

String                                 | Description                    |
-------------------------------------- | -------------------------------| 
"OK"                                   | Successful
"NOT_FOUND‚Äù                            | Prefix miss (for in the case flush_prefix command) 
"CLIENT_ERROR bad command line format" | Incorrect protocol syntax
 
## SCRUB Command

There might be items that occupy memory even if they are not available in the ARCUS Cache Server.
These items are divided into the following two types.

- If items expired in the ARCUS Cache Server, those items are not immediately removed. 
  Although those items are invalidated with the flush command, they are not removed instantly.
  These items continue to exist and occupy memory inside the ARCUS Cache Server.
  For some reason when there is an attempt to access these items, 
  ARCUS Cache Server discovers that they are in the state of expired/flushed and 
  by removing those items, it returns the occupied memory space.
- In the environment that forms the cache cloud and using key-to-node mapping of consistent hashing
  In that cache cloud, key-to-node-remapping occurs when adding or deleting a particular node.
  When such key-to-node-remapping occurs, no matter in which node, that existing items will no longer be used.
  These items are called stale items. These stale items can eventually expire, but there is a possibility for
  stale items to carry some old data and then to convert back to a valid item by key-to-node remapping.
  Therefore, these stale items must be removed whenever the node list of the cache cloud is updated.

Scrub feature refers to:
(1) a function to explicitly remove _expired items_ and similar to flushed items _invalidated items_,
(2) a function to explicitly remove _stale items_ generated from key-to-node remapping in the cache cloud.

This scrub feature is performed by daemon thread as a background operation, and 
only one scrub operation can be performed at a time. 
Therefore, it is not possible to request a new scrub operation while the other scrub operation is already in progress.

```
scrub [stale]\r\n
```

- **stale** - if not specified, it removes the invalidated items, if it's specified then removes the stale items.

Response strings and their meaning are as follows.

String                                 | Description                    |
-------------------------------------- | -------------------------------| 
"OK"                                   | Successful
"BUSY"                                 | Unable to request a new scrub operation due to the scrub operation is already in progress.
"NOT_SUPPORTED"                        | Unsupported scrub command
"CLIENT_ERROR bad command line format" | Incorrect protocol syntax

Please be aware, since the scrub command is implemented as an extension feature of ASCII command when starting ARCUS Cache Server,
scrub command can be used only by giving the run option to dynamically link the `ascii_scrub.so` file. 

## STATS Command

Retrieves or resets the various statistical information of ARCUS Cache Server.

```
stats [<args>]\r\n
```

The behavior of stats operation depending on if \<args\> is omitted or given a certain value varies as follows.

```
 <args>             | Behaviors of stats command                 |

END
```

The character in front of the colon (:) is the slab class number.
`SM` is a **small manager class** that handles small-sized data.

The description of the statistical information in the general class is as follows.

| stats           | Description                                                  |

### Prefix Statistical Information

All prefixes' item statistical information is retrieved with the `stats prefixes` command.
All prefixes' operation statistical information are retrieved with the `stats detail dump` command.
In addition, only in the operation statistical information of prefixes can be specified with ON or OFF
in order to whether or not to collect statistical information.

A sample result of item statistical information of all prefixes is as follows.
\<null\> prefix statistic indicates to items statistics that do not have prefixes.

```
PREFIX <null> itm 2 kitm 1 litm 1 sitm 0 mitm 0 bitm 0 tsz 144 ktsz 64 ltsz 80 stsz 0 mtsz 0 btsz 0 time 20121105152422
PREFIX a itm 5 kitm 5 litm 0 sitm 0 mitm 0 bitm 0 tsz 376 ktsz 376 ltsz 0 stsz 0 mtsz 0 btsz 0 time 20121105152422
PREFIX b itm 2 kitm 2 litm 0 sitm 0 mitm 0 bitm 0 tsz 144 ktsz 144 ltsz 0 stsz 0 mtsz 0 btsz 0 time 20121105152422
END
```

**itm** is total item count in the item statistical information for each prefix, where
**kitm**, **litm**, **sitm**, **mitm** and **bitm** are counts of the kv, list, set, map, b+tree respectively.
**tsz**(total size) is the size of the space occupied by the total items, and 
**ktsz**, **ltsz**, **stsz**, **mtsz**, **btsz** are the sizes of the spaces occupied by kv, list, set, map, b+tree respectively.
**time** is the prefix creation time.

Operation statistical information's result of all prefixes is as follows.
Although in reality each PREFIX line is shown as a single line, however in this document for ease the understanding
it is displayed in several lines.

```
PREFIX <null> get 2 hit 2 set 2 del 0
       lcs 0 lis 0 lih 0 lds 0 ldh 0 lgs 0 lgh 0

| zk_reconfig_version | ZooKeeper dynamic reconfiguration mirror version (16bits)        

### Scrub Performance Status

A sample of the retrieval result of the scrub performance status is as follows.

```
STAT scrubber: status stopped
STAT scrubber: last_run 0
STAT scrubber: visited 0
STAT scrubber: cleaned 0
END
```

- status : specifies whether the scrub operation is currently RUNNING or STOPPED.
- last_run : specifies required time in seconds for previously completed scrub operation.
- visited : specifies the number of items accessed in currently executing or previously executed scrub operations.
- cleaned : specifies the number of deleted items in currently executing or previously executed scrub operations.

### Cache Key Dump for Each Slab Class

Per slab class `stats cachedump` command is provided to dump cache keys of items that depend on LRU.

```
stats cachedump <slab_clsid> <limit> [ forward | backward [sticky] ]\r\n
```

- **\<slab_clsid\>** : slab class ID to specify a dump target LRU
- **\<limit\>** : number of items to dump can only be specified within the range of 0 ~ 200.
           if it's 0, then it's specified as default to 50, and if it exceeds 200, then dumped only 200.
           Starting with the head or tail of LRU dump the `limit` number of cache keys of items.
- **forward or backward** : specifies from where to start dump, the head or tail of LRU.
           If _forward_ then starts from the head, if _backward_ then it starts from the tail.
           If not specified, then the default is _forward_. 
- **sticky** : the LRU lists of non-sticky items and sticky items are maintained separately in a single slab class.
           dump in sticky LRU, if sticky is specified, if not specified then dump in the non-sticky LRU.

A sample result of the Cachedump is as follows.

```
ITEM a: bkey2
ITEM a: bkey1
ITEM b: bkey3
ITEM b: bkey1
ITEM b: bkey2
ITEM c: bkey1
ITEM c: bkey2
END
```

## CONFIG Command

ARCUS Cache Server supports a function to dynamically update or retrieve the current value of a specific configuration.
Dynamical updates are currently supported only in the below configurations, except (*) ones.

- [verbosity](ch11-command-administration-en.md#config-verbosity)
- [memlimit](ch11-command-administration-en.md#config-memlimit)
- [zkfailstop](ch11-command-administration-en.md#config-zkfailstop)
- [*hbtimeout](ch11-command-administration-en.md#config-hbtimeout)
- [*hbfailstop](ch11-command-administration-en.md#config-hbfailstop)
- [maxconns](ch11-command-administration-en.md#config-maxconns)
- [max_collection_size](ch11-command-administration-en.md#config-max_collection_size)
- [max_element_bytes](ch11-command-administration-en.md#config-max_element_bytes)
- [scrub_count](ch11-command-administration-en.md#config-scrub_count)

### config verbosity

Dynamically(without restart) updates/retrieves `verbose log level` of ARCUS Cache Server.

```
config verbosity [<verbose>]\r\n
```

As a value of verbose log level to specify \<verbose\>'s acceptable range is 0~2.
If this factor is omitted, then retrieve the value of the current set verbose.

### config memlimit

Dynamically(without restart) updates/retrieves memory limit, set with `-m` option while ARCUS Cache Server is running.

```
config memlimit [<memsize>]\r\n
```

As a memory limit to specify \<memsize\> is set in megabyte(MB) units and
can only be set to a value greater than the `total_malloced` memory size that ARCUS Cache Server is currently using.
If this factor is omitted, then retrieve the value of the current set memory limit. 

### config zkfailstop

Turns ON or OFF automatic failstop feature of ARCUS Cache Server.

```
config zkfailstop [on|off]\r\n
```

In the network failure state, if there is a cache server that cannot perform normal service in the cache cloud, then
all requests to the data range that the corresponding cache server is responsible for will fail, 
and in consequence, it will put a great burden on DB. Additionally, even if it reconnects to the ZooKeeper again,
there is a possibility that it will still have the old data which can cause malfunctioning in the application.
Therefore, to solve this issue, ARCUS Cache Server provides the `automatic failstop` feature that
automatically removes failed cache servers from the cache cloud when ZooKeeper session timeout occurs.

### config hbtimeout

Retrieves/Updates a value of `hbtimeout`.

```
config hbtimeout [<hbtimeout>]\r\n
```

ARCUS Cache Server has a `heartbeat` operation that periodically checks whether nodes operate normally.
`hbtimeout` represent the timeout of the `heartbeat` operation. If the `heartbeat` operation does not work, 
even after a time set to `hbtimeout` is exceeded, then the corresponding `heartbeat` is considered as a **timeout**.
A default value of `hbtimeout` is 10_000ms and it can be set from a minimum of 50ms to a maximum of 10_000ms.

### config hbfailstop

Retrieves/Updates a value of `hbfailstop`.

```
config hbfailstop [hbfailstop]\r\n
```

ARCUS Cache Server can force shutdown a server if a `heartbeat` delay continues.
Every time a continuous timeout occurs, a value of `hbtimeout` accumulates and adds up, 
and if the accumulated value exceeds the `hbtimeout` value then a failstop is executed.
For example, let's say a `hbfailstop` is 30 seconds, and a `hbtimeout` is 10 seconds,
if `hbtimeout` continuously occurs 3 times in a row, then failstop will be initiated.
A default value of `hbfailstop` is 60_000ms and it can be set from a minimum of 3_000ms to a maximum of 300_000ms.

### config maxconns

Dynamically(without restart) updates/retrieves maximum number of connections, set with `-c` option while ARCUS Cache Server is running.

```
config maxconns [<maxconn>]\r\n
```

As a number of maximum connections to specify \<maxconn\> can only be set to a value greater than 10% of the current number
of connections. If this factor is omitted, then retrieve the value of the currently set maximum number of connections.

### config max_collection_size

Retrieves/Updates maximum number of elements of the collection item.

```
config max_<collection>_size [<max_size>]\r\n
* <collection>: list|set|btree|map
```

A default setting is 50_000 and it can be set from a minimum of 10_000 to a maximum of 1_000_000.
It cannot be set smaller than the existing value.
If retrieve multiple elements at once, after setting it to a value greater than the default value, then 
it not only slows down the response speed of retrieve, but also critically affects the response speed of other operations.   
Therefore, as a precaution, even if the maximum number of elements increased,
the application must be implemented as retrieval requests of a small number of elements in a repetitive form at once.

### config max_element_bytes

The maximum size of the collection element's value is set in bytes.
A default setting is 16KB and it can be changed from 1 ~ 32 KB.

```
config max_element_bytes [<maxbytes>]\r\n
```

### config scrub_count

ARCUS Cache Server supports a `scrub` command to delete items in bulk that are no longer valid.
When daemon thread executes a `scrub` command `config scrub_count` command set/retrieves how many items 
will be deleted for each operation. A default value is 96 and it can be set from a minimum of 16 to a maximum of 320.

```
config scrub_count [<scrub_count>]\r\n
```

## Command Logging Command

Logging input commands into ARCUS Cache Server. 
Records all commands from the start of the `start` command until the logging is completed. 
However, for performance maintenance, there might be some skipped commands and their count can be checked with the `stats` command.
When ten of 10MB log files are used and exceeded, then they will be automatically terminated.

```
cmdlog [start [<log_file_path>] | stop | stats]\r\n
```

\<log_file_path\> is a path of a file to store logging information.

- path can be omitted, and if it is, then it is specified as a `default`.
  - if it is automatically specified with default, then the log file is created in the memcached running location / `command_log` directory.
  - `command_log` directory is not created automatically, therefore must be created at the location where the memcached process is running. 
  - `command_port_bgndate_bgntime_{n}.log` is a file name of the created log file.
- it is possible to specify the path directly as an absolute path and a relative path. The directory where the final file will be created must also be specified.

As a result of the `start` command content printed on the log file is as follows.

```

`stop` command can be used to stop logging before it is completed.

`stats` command retrieves the status of the most recently executed(or in-progress) command logging
and its result is as follows.

```

## Long Query Detect Command

In the ARCUS Cache Server among the requests for the collection items, there are some requests with a long processing time.
In order to detect them  `lqdetect` command is provided. Starting with the `start` command until the detection is completed, 
during the command processing for the commands with long query potential, 
extract commands that exceed the specific standard for a number of accessed elements, and store 20 of them as samples.
It automatically ends when storing 20 samples for all target commands of a long query.
Stored samples can be checked via the `show` command.

Target commands of long query detection are as follows.

```
1. sop get
2. lop insert
3. lop delete
4. lop get
5. bop delete
6. bop get
7. bop count
8. bop gbp
```

`lqdetect` command syntax is as follows.

```
lqdetect [start [<detect_standard>] | stop | show | stats]\r\n
```

\<detect_standard\> represents number of accessed elements in the given request that classified as long query,
in some requests, request that accesses more elements than the detection criteria are classified as long query.
If omitted, the default standard is 4000.

`start` command starts detection.

`stop` command can be used to stop detection before it is completed.

`show` command prints the stored commands sample, and the result is as follows.

```

`stats` command retrieves the status of the most recently executed(or in-progress) long query detection
and its result is as follows.

```
Long query detection stats : running              //stopped by causes(request or overflow) | running
The last running time : 20160126_175629 ~ 0_0     //bgndata_bgntime ~ enddate_endtime
The number of total long query commands : 1152    //detected_commands 
The detection standard : 43                       //standard
```

## KEY DUMP Command

Dumps keys of ARCUS Cache Server.
Dump ASCII command is as follows.

```
dump start key [<prefix>] filepath\r\n
dump stop\r\n
stats dump\r\n
```

dump start command

- the first factor is always a "key"
  - currently dump only key string
  - in the future, you can select and dump a key or an item. If it is an item, then you can dump an entire content of an item.
- the second factor is \<prefix\> of a cache key, and if not needed it can be omitted.
  - if omitted, all key strings are dumped
  - if \<null\> is given, key strings without \<prefix\> are dumped
  - if a particular prefix is given, key strings of that particular prefix are dumped
- the third factor is \<file path\>
  - MUST be specified
  - it can be assigned as an absolute path and a relative path.
  - if it is a relative path then it is a relative path of a location where memcached process is running

The `dump stop` command can be used to terminate the dump operation if its execution time is too long. 

`stats dump` command prints information about currently running or most recently performed dump operation.

Dump files are always must be made into one file. The file content format is as follows.

```
<type> <key_string> <exptime>\n
...
<type> <key_string> <exptime>\n
DUMP SUMMARY: { prefix=<prefix>, count=<count>, total=<total> elapsed=<elapsed> }\n
```

The meaning of the above result message is as follows.

- key dump result
  - \<type\> : represents item type in 1 character
    - "K" : kv
    - "L" : list
    - "S" : set
    - "M" : map
    - "B" : b+tree
  - \<key_string\> : key string of cache server
  - \<exptime\> : expire time of key. It has one of the values below.
    - 0 : exptime = 0 
    - -1 : sticky item (exptime = -1)
    - timestamp (exptime \> 0) : time since the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970) measured in seconds

- DUMP SUMMARY
  - \<prefix\> :  prefix name
    - "\<all\>" :  all key dump 
    - "\<null\>" : key dump without prefix
    - if it is a key dump of a specific prefix, then specify the that prefix name 
  - \<count\> : number of dumped keys
  - \<total\> : total number of keys in cache
  - \<elapsed\> : taking time amount to dump (unit: seconds)

## ZKensemble Command

Provides commands for setting ZooKeeper Ensemble to which ARCUS Cache Server is connected.

```
zkensemble set <ensemble_list>\r\n
zkensemble get\r\n
zkensemble rejoin\r\n
```

`set` command updates the ZK ensemble address.
ensemble_list is specified in a form of a list of ZK servers such as \<ip:port\>,...,\<ip:port\> and
in a form of a domain address of ZK ensemble. 

`get` command retrieves the ZK ensemble address. Result is retrieved in a form of \<ip:port\>,...,\<ip:port\>.

`rejoin` is a command that disconnects the ZK ensemble and connects the cache servers waiting out of the cache cloud to the ZK ensemble again.
Cache server exits the cache cloud in the following cases:
- when ZooKeeper session timeout occurs in the state of failstop OFF, 
- when ephemeral znode of cache server registered in the cache_list is deleted by operator's mistake.

## HELP Command

Retrieves the ASCII command syntax of the ARCUS Cache Server.

```
help [<subcommand>]\r\n
```

\<subcommand\> includes kv, lop, sop, mop, bop, stats, flush, config, etc.
and if \<subcommand\> is omitted, the available subcommand list to use can be printed with the `help` command.
